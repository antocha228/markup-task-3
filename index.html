                    <p>
                        Howard R. Leary, the Police Commissioner of New York City from 1966
                        to 1970, a turbulent period marked by the exposure of corruption 
                        within the department and social strife in the city, died on Monday
                        at the Buckingham Valley Nursing Center in Buckingham, Pa. Mr. Leary,
                        who lived in Solebury Township, Pa., was 82.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            The cause was congestive heart failure, said his wife, Jennie.
                        Mr. Leary was a native of Pennsylvania. He was brought to New York
                        and named Police Commissioner by John V. Lindsay shortly after he
                        became Mayor. Four years later Mr. Leary resigned.
